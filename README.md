# Semantic Neural Networks

This repository contains the source code for the experimentation of the paper: "Semantic Neural Networks".
The folders contain:

- `src`: basic source code for building SNNs.
- `notebooks`: JupyterLab notebooks which carry out the experimentation.
- `data`: important utility data

## Datasets

The datasets used in the experimentation are **not** distributed in this repository, since they are property of their respective owners. See the paper for instructions on how to obtain the datasets.

## To-do list

- Scripts for automatically downloading the datasets.
